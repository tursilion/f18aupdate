F18A ROM Updater v1.8
=====================

This is a port of the original code by Matt Hagerty and AsmusR to run entirely on the GPU, delegating only the data loading to the host system.

The goal was to create a version which is easier to port to other systems - the result of that with C code can be found [here](https://github.com/tursilion/f18aupdatecoleco)

Download the latest release here: [F18A_GPUUpdate8.bin](F18A_GPUUpdate8.bin)

This is a 256k "non-inverted" bank-switched ROM. To use this 256k file on a 512k ROM board, simply duplicate it to create a 512k file.

Matt Hagerty has released this code for free use, as do I.
